This is the directory where test cases are placed in one of the following subdirectory. 

`test_1`: is the one provided by the original challenge.

`test_2`: modifies `test_1` by changing the names of some of the same companies and products into different cases, to make sure the names are treated as case insensitive.

`test_3`: modifies `test_2` by adding one extra company name, and by adding an identical entry. The program will count the entry twice, since there could be two identical complaints filed against one company at a given year and product.
